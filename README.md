# Spatial-Based Skin Detection using Discriminative Skin-Presence Features

This repository contains the Python implementation of a skin detection algorithm based on the research paper titled "Spatial-based skin detection using discriminative skin-presence features" by Michal Kawulok, Jolanta Kawulok, Jakub Nalepa. The project was developed as part of the Digital Image Processing course at Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT) during the Spring 2022 semester under the guidance of Professor M. Rahmati (As my final project).

## Overview

Skin detection is a crucial step in various computer vision and image processing applications, including face recognition and content-based image retrieval. This project aims to replicate and extend the findings of the research paper by implementing the proposed spatial-based skin detection algorithm in Python.

## Achievement

I am proud to share that this project received the highest score in the Digital Image Processing course during the Spring 2022 semester at AUT. This achievement highlights the dedication and effort put into the implementation and experimentation, further solidifying the project's significance.
